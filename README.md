# Launching Your React Application with Create React App

This project has been initialized using [Create React App], a robust framework for building React applications.

## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the application in development mode.\

Access it via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

The page will automatically reload upon making changes.\
You may also observe any linting errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for further details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you seek more control over the build tools and configurations, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project, copying all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project for full customization.

All commands, except `eject`, will still function but will reference the copied scripts, allowing for adjustments. At this point, you are responsible for the configuration.

Ejecting is not mandatory; the curated feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments, and customization is optional until you're ready.
